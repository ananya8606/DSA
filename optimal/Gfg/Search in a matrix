/*Given a matrix mat[][] of size N x M, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order,
and a number X is given. The task is to find whether element X is present in the matrix or not.*/

/*The main part of the algorithm is the while loop, which executes until the termination condition is met. 
In each iteration of the loop, either the row or col variable is incremented or decremented by one.
Since the algorithm starts from the top-right corner of the matrix and moves either left or down, the loop will run at most N + M times.*/
